## My Projects
  
Here is some more detailed in formation about projects I have done within two years.

* Python Examples - I do not consider myself a programmer; I create these little programs as experiments to have a play with the language. I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at techjennifer@gmail.com.
create_flight_schedule.py - 
- Scenario
A new startup airline is needing help with creating and optimizing a flight schedule. They have hired you as a
data scientist to create and optimize a flight schedule. The airlines will be all business class and cater to
business travel. All aircraft are configured exactly the same and can fly any route in the system
interchangeably. The airline will serve Dallas Love Field (DAL), Austin Bergstrom (AUS), and Houston Hobby
(HOU).
